# Artificial Intelligence

This directory contains projects related to artificial intelligence course. The projects focus on implementing and evaluating various classification models from scratch.

## Projects

- **gaussian_classification.ipynb**: Implements and evaluates neural network models with different optimizers (Gradient Descent, Momentum, Adam) for classifying Gaussian-distributed data. It also includes a linear activation model for comparison.
- **mnist_classification.ipynb**: Implements and evaluates FCNN, CNN, and RNN models for classifying the MNIST dataset. It explores the effects of different optimizers, layer configurations, and learning rates.
- **spiral_classification.ipynb**: Implements and evaluates neural network models with different activation functions (ReLU, Leaky ReLU, Tanh) and optimizers (Gradient Descent, Momentum, Adam) for classifying spiral-distributed data.
